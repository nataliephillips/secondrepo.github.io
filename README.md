## Scatter Plot of Population Growth of the United States (indexed every 4 years) from 1960-2020
For this plot, I have measured the US population from 1960 to 2020. The scale of the x-axis is every four years to increase the visibility and readibility of the plot. As shown on the plot, the US population has increased in an approximately linear pattern since 1960. This conclusion makes sense as there have been no major catalysts for sudden increases in the population's growth since 1960. I received information for the plot from the data set of [US population awesome data sets](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/USA/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL?per_page=5000&format=json).

## Line Plot of Population Growth of the United States (indexed every 4 years) from 1960-2020
For this plot, I am comparing the US population rate to the Chinese population rate from 1960 to 2020. Again, the scale of the x-axis is every four years to increase the visibility and readibility of the plot. As shown on the plot, China's population has increased at a greater rate than the United States since 1960. As seen on the graph, the two populations start to diverge in 90s. I received information for the plot from the above [US population awesome data sets](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/USA/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL?per_page=5000&format=json) and the [CN population awesome data sets](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/CHN/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL?per_page=5000&format=json)
